# React Movies-Tinder App

Single-Page App for choosing movies from fake API.

## Description

User can choose a movie from 3 options. Website shows movie's rating (with stars), summary, title, and poster/image of the movie. As it is single-page website, it has navbar which does not do much, but it's there. Also there are some effects/animations as I love to do them even if they are unnecessary.

Technologies: <b>React</b> <b>SCSS</b> <b>Typescript</b> and mighty <b>.JSON</b> file

I created a small website graphic design using Figma, so that is how website looks

#### Additional Quotes 

App does not have any test included as I have no idea how to do them properly, (but it expects True to be True). I could do some from youtube tutorials, but I don't want ot fake that I know what I would be doing
Every other requirement I believe is there.

I have no idea how to test logic for data fetching <br>
I used context provider there If that is what you asked me to do :).
